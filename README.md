# Operating System

This repository contains assignments, lab tasks, and independent practice for Operating Systems that I completed during my Bachelor's at GIKI.

# Download the Book

To download the book, execute the following commands:

```zsh
cd book_downloader
chmod u+x script.sh
./script.sh
```

>Note: Make sure to use the correct shell (bash or zsh) as specified in the script's shebang line. If on windows, then run the `.py` files seperately
